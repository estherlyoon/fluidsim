TODO:

make placed pixels bigger
get forces to work and push color around
    - add force to grid scaled by some constant?
pressure operator
    - divergence, more jacobi, pressure gradient
boundary conditions
smoke characteristics
    - temperature
    - density
do it all in CUDA too :-)

bells and whistles:
    - variable color and size smoke added (GUI?)
    - more complex smoke-adding mechanisms
    - user-added boundaries
    - fancier swirls
    - 3D
    - ...
